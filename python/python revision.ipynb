    "### The high level\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) is a interpreted, high level programming language created by Dutch programmer [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I always say, Python *is old*. It gained a lot of traction around 2006, with its popularity being driven its beauty and simplicity to do Web Development (its main Web Development Framework, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), was released in 2006). From there, it took off as one of the most popular scripting languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is multi-paradigm: you can write code using Object Oriented, Functional and/or Imperative programming. Python is interpreted and uses a dynamic type system, although considered _strongly typed_.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has an extensive builtin standard library with features that ranges from time management, to http servers, concurrency and async programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is Open Source and is managed by a non-profit organization: the [Python Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation).\n",

    "## Python 3 vs Python 2\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have heard that there are two main versions of Python around: _Python 2_ and _Python 3_. Well, I'll keep it simple for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üëç Python 3: YES!\n",
    "### üôÖ Python 2: NO!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2 [will be deprecated in 2020](https://pythonclock.org/). So **stick to Python 3**, it's the present and the future of the language (at least until we start planning Python 4 üòÖ, just kidding).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A quick note about different \"implementations\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, all what I'm saying here technically applies to \"CPython\", Python's main _implementation_. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense. It's just for the curious ones. If you're interested, we've written an entire post about it: [A quick guide about Python implementations](https://blog.rmotr.com/a-quick-guide-about-python-implementations-aa224109f321).\n",

    "### Indentation based\n",
    "\n",
    "This might feel weird at first, but in Python we do NOT use curly braces to denote blocks of code. We use _\"indentation\"_ instead. This is similar to Ruby. For example, this is a very simple `add_numbers` function in javascript:\n",
